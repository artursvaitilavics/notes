- Sort by date not working, something with notes.sortByDate()
- Create sort by date functionality:
    - means we need date and time value for each note
- style each note caintainer:
    - use icons for expand and delte
    - make text area stretch to the end

- Expand button on note should show whole text in input field - no clue, will take time
